# Nico Pranama – Dynamic Portfolio with Admin Panel

This project is a dynamic personal portfolio website built with **PHP Laravel**, featuring a simple **admin interface** that allows content updates to be reflected instantly on the user-facing site.

It is designed to make updating personal data, project showcases, and skill lists effortless — without editing any code manually.

## Overview

The system consists of two main parts:

1. **Public Portfolio View (User-facing)**  
   - Displays your profile, bio, skills, and project list  
   - Visually appealing one-page layout  
   - Automatically updates whenever the admin makes changes

2. **Admin Dashboard**  
   - Secure login system  
   - Allows you to add, edit, or delete:
     - Projects
     - Skills
     - About Me content
     - Contact info  
   - CRUD-based interface with real-time updates

## How It Works

- The admin dashboard manages all portfolio content.
- All data is stored in a **shared database**.
- Changes made via the admin panel are reflected immediately on the portfolio homepage.
- No need to redeploy or touch code for every update.
